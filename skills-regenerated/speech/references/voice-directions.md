# Voice Directions and Instruction Patterns

## Instruction Template

Use only the lines you need. Keep directions concise and aligned to the input text.

```
Voice Affect: <overall character and texture>
Tone: <attitude, formality, warmth>
Pacing: <slow, steady, brisk>
Emotion: <key emotions to convey>
Pronunciation: <words to enunciate or emphasize>
Pauses: <where to insert brief pauses>
Emphasis: <key phrases to stress>
Delivery: <cadence or rhythm notes>
```

## Best Practices

- Use a consistent order: affect, tone, pacing, emotion, pronunciation, pauses, emphasis, delivery
- Keep 4-8 short lines. Avoid conflicting instructions ("fast and slow").
- Prefer concrete guidance over adjectives alone ("slow and measured" not just "good").
- Do not rewrite the input text in the instructions; only guide delivery.
- For names/acronyms, add pronunciation hints ("A-I" instead of "AI") or phonetic spelling.
- Use punctuation or line breaks in input text to create natural pauses.
- Start with a clean base, then iterate with one change at a time.
- Repeat critical constraints on each iteration ("keep pacing steady").
