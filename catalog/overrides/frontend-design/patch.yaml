  Overview: |
    Frontend Design generates distinctive, production-grade web interfaces
    with high visual quality. It produces React/Next.js components styled
    with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, avoiding generic AI aesthetics.

  Workflow: |
    1. Analyze the user's requirements and identify the interface type
    2. Choose a bold aesthetic direction and commit to it
    3. Build the component with semantic HTML, Tailwind, and React
    4. Apply finishing touches: micro-interactions, shadows, transitions
    5. Verify the output against the checklist below

  Examples: |
    ```
    User: "Build a dashboard for analytics"
    → Generates a responsive React dashboard with charts, cards, and navigation
    ```

    ```
    User: "Create a landing page for a SaaS product"
    → Produces a full-page layout with hero, features, pricing, and CTA sections
    ```

  Output Checklist: |
    - [ ] Semantic HTML structure
    - [ ] Responsive across breakpoints
    - [ ] Consistent color palette and typography
    - [ ] Accessible (keyboard navigation, contrast ratios)
    - [ ] No generic AI aesthetic patterns
