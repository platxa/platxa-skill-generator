  "description": "Use when Codex is building or iterating on a web game (HTML/JS) and needs a reliable development + testing loop: implement small changes, run a Playwright-based test script with short input bursts and intentional pauses, inspect screenshots/text, and review console errors with render_game_to_text.",

  "key_workflows": [
    "Pick a goal. Define a single feature or behavior to implement",
    "Implement small. Make the smallest change that moves the game forward",
    "Ensure integration points. Provide a single canvas and window.render_game_to_text so the test loop can read state",
    "Add window.advanceTime(ms). Strongly prefer a deterministic step hook so the Playwright script can advance frames reliably; without it, automated tests can be flaky",
    "Initialize progress.md. If progress.md exists, read it first and confirm the original user prompt is recorded at the top (prefix with Original prompt:). Also note any TODOs and suggestions left by the previous agent. If missing, create it and write Original prompt: <prompt> at the top before appending updates",
    "Verify Playwright availability. Ensure playwright is available (local dependency or global install). If unsure, check npx first",
    "Run the Playwright test script. You must run $WEB_GAME_CLIENT after each meaningful change; do not invent a new client unless required",
    "Use the payload reference. Base actions on $WEB_GAME_ACTIONS to avoid guessing keys",
    "Inspect state. Capture screenshots and text state after each burst",
    "Inspect screenshots. Open the latest screenshot, verify expected visuals, fix any issues, and rerun the script. Repeat until correct",
    "Verify controls and state (multi-step focus). Exhaustively exercise all important interactions. For each, think through the full multi-step sequence it implies (cause → intermediate states → outcome) and verify the entire chain works end-to-end. Confirm render_game_to_text reflects the same state shown on screen. If anything is off, fix and rerun",
    "Check errors. Review console errors and fix the first new issue before continuing",
    "Reset between scenarios. Avoid cross-test state when validating distinct features",
    "Iterate with small deltas. Change one variable at a time (frames, inputs, timing, positions), then repeat steps 7–13 until stable",
