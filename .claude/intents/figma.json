Returns structured design data and default React + Tailwind code. Selection-based prompting works on desktop; the remote server uses a frame/layer link to extract the node ID. - `get_variable_defs` (Figma Design): Lists variables/styles (colors, spacing, typography) used in the selection. Useful to align with tokens."
