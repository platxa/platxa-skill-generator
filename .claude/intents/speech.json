Speech generation uses the OpenAI Audio API, so the CLI needs outbound network access. In many Codex setups, network access is disabled by default (especially under stricter sandbox modes), and/or the approval policy may require confirmation before networked commands run. If you trust the repo and want fewer prompts, enable network access for the relevant sandbox mode and relax the approval policy."
